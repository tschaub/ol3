title: Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)
shortdesc: Rendering a COG as a tiled layer.
docs: >
  Tiled data from a Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) can be rendered as a layer.  In this
  example, a single 3-band GeoTIFF is used to render RGB data.  The `nodata` property is
  used to avoid rendering pixels where all three bands are 0.
